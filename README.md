# CS 432 - Smart Roads by Smartifiers
The road signs and speed limits are fixed in present-day structures. However, there
may be situations where the speed limit must be changed according to the road and weather
conditions. We can consider that there can be some road diversions due to heavy traffic or
accidents then we can change the road signs accordingly if they are digitized. With our
product, SmartRoads, traffic control will be easier and more efficient by dynamically
adjusting the speed limit for that road. Traffic density will be detected by our product via
computer vision. The optimal vehicle speed limit will be determined by measuring the air and
road conditions such as temperature, air pressure and humidity of the area. The smart traffic
signs that are adjusted according to this data will be displayed on the sign for the drivers. The
product will be powered by solar energy. Drivers can also use an application to see the traffic
density, road conditions anywhere on their phones.

# Notes
* All parts of the project are in the relevant subfolders.
* The circuit diagram and the photos of the circuits can be found in the Midterm and Final presentations.
* There may not be a data flow for now, since there is no active sensor.
